## Piece 12 of 12 — Verify install

```text
For app bankr-communities-v2:

1. List all files that exist in the app
2. Dry-run syncTokens — must return ok:true, NOT "File not found"
3. Dry-run createCommunity — should return tokenAddress required (NOT SyntaxError, NOT File not found)
4. Confirm index.html footer says "rayblanco.eth · v11"
5. Enable syncTokens schedule: 0 * * * *
6. Make the app public
```

---

## After all 12 pieces

1. Open **bankr-communities-v2** in Apps panel
2. Click **Refresh**
3. Run **syncTokens** once
4. Search for a token in Create Community

## Expected results

| Check | Expected |
|-------|----------|
| App slug | `bankr-communities-v2` |
| Footer | `made with love <3 rayblanco.eth · v11` |
| syncTokens | `{ "ok": true, "totalLaunches": ... }` |
| App panel | Loads — no "Failed to load app" |

## If a piece fails with "File not found"

Stop and tell Bankr:

```text
App bankr-communities-v2 storage is broken. The registry exists but runtime files are missing.
Please create a fresh app storage bucket or escalate to platform support.
Do not write to CLI sandbox /apps/ — that does not reach runtime storage.
```
